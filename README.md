Dumb and deaf people face a lot of problems when it comes to itneracting with others, they cannot have a smooth converstation with others  as the only way they can  converse is using hand gestures , signs and symbol. It is also difficult for normal people to interpret their signs as not everyone knows their way of talking. So we are trying to make this conversation easy between  a dumb and deaf person and a normal person.

In our project we are trying to make the conversation simple between the dumb deaf people and normal people. We are building a model which converts the speech of a person first into words helping the dumb deaf people to read and understand the speech of other person amd then it converts the words into hand gestures undersandable by the dumb deaf people, hence making the conversation very easy.
